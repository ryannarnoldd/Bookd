## Description

Bookd (CHECK THIS OUT!) is a web application that allows users to review books they have read, add them to a TBR (to be read) and read list, and view what other users are reading. The premise of our project is to create an easy way to keep track and share what books the user is reading, with the simple use of OpenLibrary API to view information on books. There will be a login and authentication system that allows the user to save their information and it will all be stored in a database using PostgreSQL and Sequelize ORM. Our goal is to make a UI-friendly system that takes the complexity out of sorting through your bookshelf at home.

## Usage

The usage of this application is simple. The user has to first make an account using their email and an username and password, of their choice. The user can create posts about books that they read. They can also update and delete, only their own posts. The user can also view a certain user's post, by clicking on their name link. And go to their home feed to see what everyone else has been reading.
